# Quiz 1 Part 2 for CIS 2203 - Mobile Development

Create a console based, menu driven calculator application that asks the user to input 2 operands. After, the user will be asked to choose from the following operations:

1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
The result will then be displayed after the calculation.

 

Notes:

Application can also accept a decimal number which can be used for operations with whole and decimal numbers.
The program must also have a memory function which is the ability to use the previous result as an operand for the next calculation.
User will be asked another input if the number is invalid.
If result has decimal values, display the result in 2 decimal places, otherwise display only the whole number.
Every time a calculation is done or input for an operation is invalid, go back to the start and repeat the whole process for another round of calculation.
